The {\bfseries{Sprite Shape}} is a flexible and powerful world building Asset that features Sprite tiling along a shape\textquotesingle{}s outline that automatically deforms and swaps Sprites based on the angle of the outline. Additionally, you can assign a Fill texture to a Sprite Shape to create filled shapes with tiled textures as backgrounds or other large level-\/building props.

The following are examples of Sprite Shapes used to construct different parts of various levels.







Sprite Shapes comprise of two parts -\/ the /\+Users/ray/\+Documents/\+Git\+Hub/\+Game\+Dev/\+Space\+Survival/\+Library/\+Package\+Cache/com.unity.\+2d.\+spriteshape@3.\+0.\+11/\+Documentation$\sim$/\+S\+S\+Profile.md \char`\"{}\+Sprite Shape Profile\char`\"{} Asset, and the /\+Users/ray/\+Documents/\+Git\+Hub/\+Game\+Dev/\+Space\+Survival/\+Library/\+Package\+Cache/com.unity.\+2d.\+spriteshape@3.\+0.\+11/\+Documentation$\sim$/\+S\+S\+Controller.md \char`\"{}\+Sprite Shape Controller\char`\"{} component. The Sprite Shape Profile contains the angle settings and Sprites used by the Sprite Shape, and you edit the Sprite Shape\textquotesingle{}s outline with the Sprite Shape Controller component.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md320}{}\doxysection{Importing Sprites for Sprite Shapes}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md320}
We recommend using the following settings when importing Sprites for a Sprite Shape\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TextureTypes.html\#Sprite}{\texttt{ Texture Type}} -\/ Set this to {\bfseries{Sprite (2D and UI)}}. Other texture types are not supported for Sprite Shapes.
\item {\bfseries{Sprite Mode}} -\/ Set this to {\bfseries{Single}} if the texture contains only a single Sprite.
\item {\bfseries{Mesh Type}} -\/ Set this to {\bfseries{Full Rect}}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md321}{}\doxysection{Sprite Shape Workflow}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md321}
Create {\bfseries{Sprite Shapes}} in following the steps\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Create a {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Profile}} from the main menu (menu\+: {\bfseries{Assets $>$ Create $>$ Sprite Shape Profile}}). Select from the two available options\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{SSProfile.html\#open-shape}{\texttt{ Open Shape}}
\item \href{SSProfile.html\#closed-shape}{\texttt{ Closed Shape}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Create \href{SSProfile.html\#creating-angle-ranges}{\texttt{ Angle Ranges}} and \href{SSProfile.html\#assigning-sprites}{\texttt{ assign Sprites}} in the {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Profile}}.
\item Drag the {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Profile}} into the Scene to automatically generate a {\bfseries{Sprite Shape}} Game\+Object based on that Profile.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item You can create a Sprite Shape Game\+Object without a Profile from the main menu (menu\+: {\bfseries{Game\+Object $>$ 2D Object $>$ Sprite Shape}}). Then select a Sprite Shape Profile in the {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Controller}}\textquotesingle{}s {\bfseries{Profile}} settings. The same Profile can be used by multiple Sprite Shapes. ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Edit the outline of the Sprite Shape with the /\+Users/ray/\+Documents/\+Git\+Hub/\+Game\+Dev/\+Space\+Survival/\+Library/\+Package\+Cache/com.unity.\+2d.\+spriteshape@3.\+0.\+11/\+Documentation$\sim$/\+S\+S\+Controller.md \char`\"{}\+Sprite Shape Controller\char`\"{} component settings.
\item Enable \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Physics2DManager.html}{\texttt{ Physics2D}} interactions for your Sprite Shapes by attaching a /\+Users/ray/\+Documents/\+Git\+Hub/\+Game\+Dev/\+Space\+Survival/\+Library/\+Package\+Cache/com.unity.\+2d.\+spriteshape@3.\+0.\+11/\+Documentation$\sim$/\+S\+S\+Collision.md \char`\"{}\+Collider\char`\"{} component.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Attach a {\bfseries{Collider 2D}} component to your Sprite Shape to enable the Collider properties in the {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Controller.}} Only the {\bfseries{Edge}} and {\bfseries{Polygon Collider 2D}} components can be used with {\bfseries{Sprite Shapes}}.



The Collider mesh automatically updates itself to the shape of the Sprite Shape when attached. See the Collider section of the /\+Users/ray/\+Documents/\+Git\+Hub/\+Game\+Dev/\+Space\+Survival/\+Library/\+Package\+Cache/com.unity.\+2d.\+spriteshape@3.\+0.\+11/\+Documentation$\sim$/\+S\+S\+Controller.md \char`\"{}\+Sprite Shape Controller\char`\"{} page for more details about the Sprite Shape Collider options.

By default, the Collider mesh is automatically reshaped to match the Sprite Shape every time it is edited. To make manual edits to the Collider mesh directly, first disable both {\bfseries{Update Collider}} and {\bfseries{Optimize Collider}} in the {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Controller\textquotesingle{}s}} Collider settings to prevent the Controller from updating the Collider mesh automatically and overriding your manual edits.



You can now edit the Collider mesh independent of the shape of the {\bfseries{Sprite Shape.}}

The {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Controller}} component is automatically attached to the Game\+Object created when a {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Profile}} is dragged into the Scene. You edit the shape of the Sprite Shape\textquotesingle{}s outline through the Controller\textquotesingle{}s settings. The Controller displays different settings depending on different conditions.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md324}{}\doxysection{Property Settings -\/ Default}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md324}

To edit the mesh outline of the {\bfseries{Sprite Shape}}, click the {\bfseries{Edit Spline}} button to make the Shape\textquotesingle{}s spline and its {\bfseries{Control Points}} become visible and editable.



When {\bfseries{Edit Spline}} is enabled, move the Control Points of the Sprite Shape to adjust its overall shape and size. Add additional Control Points by clicking on the spline in between Control Points. Press the {\bfseries{Del/\+Delete}} key to remove the currently selected Control Point.



With a Control Point selected, cycle through the {\bfseries{Point Modes \+\_\+\+\_\+by pressing the \+\_\+\+\_\+M}} key. To change the {\bfseries{Mode}} of multiple Control Points at once, ensure that all selected Control Points are the same {\bfseries{Mode}} first before cycling or selecting another {\bfseries{Mode}}.

To change the Sprite Variant currently displayed at a selected Control Point, press the {\bfseries{N}} key to cycle through all available Variants.

All shortcut keys can be rebound under the Shortcut menu (menu\+: {\bfseries{Edit $>$ Shortcuts... $>$ Sprite\+Shape Editing}}).\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md328}{}\doxysection{Point Modes}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md328}
When a Control Point is selected, its {\bfseries{Point Mode}} can be one of three modes-\/ {\bfseries{Linear}}, {\bfseries{Mirrored}}, and {\bfseries{Non-\/\+Mirrored}}.

The {\bfseries{Point Mode}} determines the behavior of the tangents that are used to adjust the spline between Control Points. Each Control Point can be set to a specific Point Mode and contain its own settings.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md329}{}\doxysubsection{Linear Point Mode}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md329}
In {\bfseries{Linear Point Mode}}, there are no tangents to control the curve between the Control Point and its neighbors, curves are not formed between Control Points and Sprites may overlap if they intersect.

Adjust which Sprite is displayed when two or more intersect by adjusting their {\bfseries{Order}} value in the /\+Users/ray/\+Documents/\+Git\+Hub/\+Game\+Dev/\+Space\+Survival/\+Library/\+Package\+Cache/com.unity.\+2d.\+spriteshape@3.\+0.\+11/\+Documentation$\sim$/\+S\+S\+Profile.md \char`\"{}\+Sprite Shape Profile\textquotesingle{}s\char`\"{} {\bfseries{Angle Range}} settings.

In {\bfseries{Continuous Mirrored Point Mode}}, tangents appear on both sides of the selected Control Point to create a curve between the Control Point and its neighbors. Adjust the shape of the curve with the tangents. In this mode, the angle between the tangents is always maintained at 180 degrees although their lengths from the can vary.

Press {\bfseries{B}} to mirror the length of the last edited tangent onto the opposite tangent.

\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md331}{}\doxysubsection{Broken Mirrored Point Mode}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md331}
In {\bfseries{Broken Mirrored Point Mode}}, tangents appear on both sides of the selected Control Point to create a curve between the Control Point and its neighbors. Adjust the shape of the curve with the tangents. In this mode, the length and angle of each tangent can be adjusted independently.

Press {\bfseries{B}} to mirror the length of the last edited tangent onto the opposite tangent. In this mode, pressing {\bfseries{B}} also causes the angle of the opposite tangent to become exactly 180 degrees from the last edited tangent.



The {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Profile}} contains the settings that determine which Sprites that appear on a Sprite Shape at specific Angle Ranges, as well as other display settings. You can use the same Profile for multiple {\bfseries{Sprite Shapes}} in a Scene.

Create a {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Profile}} from the Editor main menu (menu\+: {\bfseries{Assets $>$ Create $>$ Sprite Shape Profile}}), and select from the two available options\+: {\bfseries{Open Shape}} and {\bfseries{Closed Shape}}.

Use the {\bfseries{Open Shape}} preset Profile to create Shapes made from a single edge outline with tiled Sprites along its edge. This preset is ideal for creating level elements such as platforms.



Drag the Open Shape Profile into the Scene view to automatically generate a Sprite Shape with {\bfseries{Open Ended}} enabled in its {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Controller}} settings.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md334}{}\doxysection{Closed Shape}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md334}


Use the {\bfseries{Closed Shape}} preset Profile to create Shapes that encompass an enclosed area. The Closed Sprite Shape can display and tile a Fill texture in the enclosed area, if a Fill texture is set in its Profile settings. Use this preset to create large solid filled Shapes that are ideal for backgrounds or large platforms.



Drag the Closed Shape Profile into the Scene view to automatically generate a Sprite Shape with {\bfseries{Open Ended}} disabled in its {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Controller}} settings. The Closed Shape Profile\textquotesingle{}s preset Angle Ranges create a square Sprite Shape by default.

A key feature of the {\bfseries{Sprite Shape Profile}} is the Angle Ranges tool. Assigning an Angle Range determines what Sprite is displayed at specific angles, as the Sprite Shape is deformed in the Scene.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md335}{}\doxysection{Creating Angle Ranges}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md335}

To create an Angle Range, click the {\bfseries{Create Range}} button at the bottom of the Angle Ranges tool\+:



The {\bfseries{Create Range}} button is only visible if the {\bfseries{Preview Handle}} is over an area without an Angle Range (see the example image below).

Another way is to hover your cursor over an empty area of the Angle Range circle. An outline appears to show the possible default angle range. Click to create this Angle Range.

\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md338}{}\doxysubsection{Editing the Angle Range degrees}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md338}
The range covered by the currently selected Angle Range is displayed at the bottom of the tool.



You can edit a range by entering new values into {\bfseries{Start}} and {\bfseries{End}}, or drag either endpoint of the tool to the desired angles. A range cannot be extended into an existing neighboring range. To delete an Angle Range, select the range and then press the {\bfseries{Del/\+Delete}} key.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md339}{}\doxysection{Assigning Sprites}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__documentation_autotoc_md339}
After creating the Angle Ranges, the next step is to assign Sprites to those ranges. The {\bfseries{Sprites}} list is found beneath the {\bfseries{Angle Ranges}} tool. It lists all the Sprites assigned to the selected range.



To add Sprites to the list, click the {\bfseries{+}} icon to insert a new row to the list. Click the circle icon next to the empty row to open the {\bfseries{Object Picker}} window, which displays all available Sprites in the project.



You can also drag a Sprite directly onto a row to add it to the list. The Sprite at the top of the list is the default Sprite displayed on the Sprite Shape. Refer to the other Sprites in the list by their /\+Users/ray/\+Documents/\+Git\+Hub/\+Game\+Dev/\+Space\+Survival/\+Library/\+Package\+Cache/com.unity.\+2d.\+spriteshape@3.\+0.\+11/\+Documentation$\sim$/\+S\+S\+Controller.md \char`\"{}\+Sprite Variant\char`\"{} number.
