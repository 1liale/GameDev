The P\+SD Importer is an Asset importer that is specialized for importing Adobe Photoshop .psb files into \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} and generating a Prefab made of Sprites based on the source file. The .psb file format is functionally identical to the more common Adobe .psd format and can support much larger images than the .psd format (up to 300,000 by 300,000 pixels in size).

You can save or convert your Photoshop artwork files into the .psb format and import them into \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} with the P\+SD Importer. When you import .psb files with the P\+SD Importer, you can use features such as \href{\#Mosaic}{\texttt{ Mosaic}} to automatically generate a Sprite sheet from the imported layers; or \href{\#Rig}{\texttt{ Character Rig}} where \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} reassembles the Sprites of a character as they are arranged in their source files.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8psdimporter_0d2_81_84__documentation_autotoc_md234}{}\doxysection{Non-\/importable Photoshop effects}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8psdimporter_0d2_81_84__documentation_autotoc_md234}
The P\+SD Importer only supports two \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TextureTypes.html}{\texttt{ Texture Modes}}\+: \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TextureTypes.html\#Default}{\texttt{ Default}} and \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TextureTypes.html\#Sprite}{\texttt{ Sprite}}. Other Texture Modes might be supported in the future.

The following Photoshop features are not supported by the P\+SD Importer and it ignores the following layer effects and features while it generates Sprites\+: ~\newline

You can also add additional Textures to the Sprites with the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpriteEditor.html}{\texttt{ Sprite Edito}}r’s \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpriteEditor-SecondaryTextures.html}{\texttt{ Secondary Textures}} module. Shaders can sample these Secondary Textures to apply additional effects to the Sprite, such as normal mapping.

The {\bfseries{Character Rig}} setting makes the P\+SD Importer generate a Prefab that contains \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Sprites.html}{\texttt{ Sprites}} it generates from each layer of the imported source file. The P\+SD Importer automatically gives the Sprites an \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/2DSorting.html\#sortlayer}{\texttt{ Order in Layer}} value that sorts them according to the layer hierarchy in the source file. This ensures that \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} recreates the character artwork in the correct order in the Prefab.

The name of each Sprite in the Prefab is the same as their respective source layer, unless a \href{\#NameCollision}{\texttt{ name collision error}} occurs, which is usually due to duplicate names in the source layers.

If the Sprite contains bone or weight data, the P\+SD Importer automatically adds the {\bfseries{Sprite Skin}} component to it. This happens if the Sprite has been \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@3.0/manual/CharacterRig.html}{\texttt{ rigged}} with bones and weights in the \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@3.0/manual/SkinningEditor.html}{\texttt{ Skinning Editor}} already and the source file is being reimported, or you have manually \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.2d.animation@3.0/manual/CopyPasteSkele.html}{\texttt{ copied and pasted}} the bone and weight data onto the Sprites.

Refer to the examples below of a character designed in Photoshop with its various parts and limbs separated onto different layers.

Enable this setting to discard all user modifications for the current set of Sprite\+Rect data and regenerate all Sprite\+Rects based on the current source file. Extra Sprite\+Rect metadata (such as weights and bones data) persist if they remain valid with the regenerated Sprite\+Rects.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8psdimporter_0d2_81_84__documentation_autotoc_md241}{}\doxysection{How the P\+S\+D Importer uses Sprite\+Rect data}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8psdimporter_0d2_81_84__documentation_autotoc_md241}
The P\+SD Importer can store four separate sets of \href{https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Sprite-rect.html}{\texttt{ Sprite\+Rect}} data, with a set for each of the four combinations of importer property settings below\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Sprite Mode}} set to {\bfseries{Single}}.
\item {\bfseries{Sprite Mode}} set to {\bfseries{Multiple}}.
\item {\bfseries{Sprite Mode}} set to {\bfseries{Multiple,}} and {\bfseries{Mosaic}} enabled.
\item {\bfseries{Sprite Mode}} set to {\bfseries{Multiple}}, and both {\bfseries{Mosaic}} and {\bfseries{Character Rig}} enabled.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Each set of data is persistent, and does not affect or overwrite the data of other sets. This means you can save different Sprite\+Rect data for different importer settings for the same source file. The Sprite\+Rect data persists even if you modify the dimensions and position of images in the source file, as long as the original \href{https://github.com/adobe-photoshop/generator-core/wiki/Understanding-Layer-IDs-and-Layer-Indices}{\texttt{ Layer ID}} of the source layers remain the same.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8psdimporter_0d2_81_84__documentation_autotoc_md242}{}\doxysubsection{Modifying the Sprite\+Rect data}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8psdimporter_0d2_81_84__documentation_autotoc_md242}
The Sprite\+Rect defines the location of the Sprite on the Texture that \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} generates from the imported source file. You can modify the location and size of each Sprite\+Rect in the Sprite Editor.

~\newline
\+\_\+\+Original Sprite\+Rect location of the ‘head’ Sprite on the combined Sprite sheet Texture.\+\_\+

When you enable the \href{\#Mosaic}{\texttt{ Mosaic}} importer setting, the P\+SD Importer arranges the different layers of the source file together to form a single combined Texture when you import it. The importer generates a Sprite\+Rect for each of these imported layers, and follows the position of its associated layer wherever it is placed in the Mosaic Texture.

~\newline
\+\_\+\+The Sprite\+Rect of the ‘head’ layer. The Sprite\+Rect has been moved from its original position.\+\_\+

~\newline
\+\_\+\+The source file reimported after hiding several layers. The Sprite\+Rect follows the ‘head’ layer’s placement in the new Texture.\+\_\+

However, a Sprite\+Rect’s size and position remains the same if you change the image or canvas size of its source layer in the source file. You must manually edit the size and position of the Sprite\+Rect in the Sprite Editor, or select and apply the \href{\#heading=h.i7pxu2xdxrji}{\texttt{ Reslice}} option to regenerate it from the source file.

Sprite\+Rect data persists until you manually delete the Sprite\+Rect, or select the \href{\#heading=h.i7pxu2xdxrji}{\texttt{ Reslice}} option and apply it in the importer settings. When you do this, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} discards all user modifications for the current set of Sprite\+Rect data and regenerates all the Sprite\+Rects from the current source file.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8psdimporter_0d2_81_84__documentation_autotoc_md243}{}\doxysubsection{Summary of source file modifications and their effects on Sprite\+Rect data}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8psdimporter_0d2_81_84__documentation_autotoc_md243}

A name collision error can happen due to the following \+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Two or more layers in the imported source file have the same name. However, Photoshop \href{https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/selecting-grouping-linking-layers.html\#group_and_link_layers}{\texttt{ group layers}} with the same names do not cause this issue.
\item A new layer that the P\+SD Importer creates in the source file has the same name as a Sprite\+Rect you have created or modified.
\item A layer is renamed to the same name as a Sprite\+Rect you have modified.
\item A previously hidden layer is made visible and imported, and it has the same name as an existing Sprite\+Rect.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

When a name collision occurs, one Sprite\+Rect retains the original name while the other is appended with a running number. Which Sprite\+Rect retains their original name is based on the following priority\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item A Sprite\+Rect you have created or modified.
\item The first layer in the source file, starting from the bottom of the layer stack.
\item Currently existing Sprite\+Rects in the Project.
