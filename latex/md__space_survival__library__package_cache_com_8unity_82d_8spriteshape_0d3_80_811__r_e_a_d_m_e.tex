Use the {\bfseries{2D Sprite\+Shape}} package as a powerful worldbuilding tool that allows you to tile Sprites along the path of a shape, with the Sprites automatically deforming in response to different angles according to their settings. For example, use {\bfseries{2D Sprite\+Shapes}} to quickly build various 2D platforms by editing their spline paths into different shapes.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md342}{}\doxysection{Installing 2\+D Sprite\+Shape}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8spriteshape_0d3_80_811__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md342}
