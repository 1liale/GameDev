A C\# math library providing vector types and math functions with a shader like syntax. Used by the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_burst}{Burst}} compiler to compile C\#/\+IL to highly efficient native code.

The main goal of this library is to provide a friendly Math A\+PI familiar to S\+I\+MD and graphic/shaders developers, using the well known {\ttfamily float4}, {\ttfamily float3} types...etc. with all intrinsics functions provided by a static class {\ttfamily math} that can be imported easily into your C\# program with {\ttfamily using static Unity.\+Mathematics.\+math}.

In addition to this, the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_burst}{Burst}} compiler is able to recognize these types and provide the optimized S\+I\+MD type for the running C\+PU on all supported platforms (x64, A\+R\+Mv7a...etc.)

N\+O\+T\+I\+CE\+: The A\+PI is a work in progress and we may introduce breaking changes (A\+PI and underlying behavior)\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8mathematics_0d1_81_80__documentation_autotoc_md406}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8mathematics_0d1_81_80__documentation_autotoc_md406}
You can use this library in your \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} game by using the Package Manager and referencing the package {\ttfamily com.\+unity.\+mathematics}. See the forum \href{https://forum.unity.com/threads/welcome.522627}{\texttt{ Welcome}} page for more details.

After years of feedback and experience with the previous A\+PI, we believe that providing an A\+PI that is closer to the way graphics developers have been using math libraries should better help its adoption and the ease of its usage. H\+L\+SL / G\+L\+SL math library is a very well designed, well understood math library leading to greater consistency.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8mathematics_0d1_81_80__documentation_autotoc_md411}{}\doxysubsection{Why not using $<$tt$>$\+System.\+Numerics.\+Vectors$<$/tt$>$?}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8mathematics_0d1_81_80__documentation_autotoc_md411}
Mainly for the reason mentioned above, {\ttfamily System.\+Numerics.\+Vectors} is in many ways similar to our previous Vector library (more object oriented than graphics programming oriented). Also the fact that our \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_burst}{Burst}} compiler is able to recognize a lot more patterns for S\+I\+MD types and math intrinsics makes it easier to work with a dedicated A\+PI that reflects this ability.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8mathematics_0d1_81_80__documentation_autotoc_md412}{}\doxysubsection{Naming convention}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8mathematics_0d1_81_80__documentation_autotoc_md412}
In C\# {\ttfamily int} and {\ttfamily float} are considered builtin types. \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_burst}{Burst}} extends this set of bultin types to also include vectors, matrices and quaternions. These types are bultin in the sense that \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_burst}{Burst}} knows about them and is be able to generate better code using these types than what would be possible with equivalent code using custom types.

To signify that these types are bultin their type names are in all lower case. The operators on these bultin types found in {\ttfamily Unity.\+Mathematics.\+math} are considered intrinsics and are thus always in lower case.

There are no plans to extend the set of intrinsic types beyond the current set of vectors ({\ttfamily typeN}), matrices ({\ttfamily type\+NxN}) and quaternions ({\ttfamily quaternion}).

This convention has the added benefit of making the library highly compatible with shader code and makes porting or sharing code between the two almost frictionless.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8mathematics_0d1_81_80__documentation_autotoc_md413}{}\doxysubsection{Why can\textquotesingle{}t we send a P\+R yet?}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8mathematics_0d1_81_80__documentation_autotoc_md413}
