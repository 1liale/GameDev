This is the packaged version of Collab, currently limited to containing the History and Toolbar windows, along with supporting classes.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8collab-proxy_0d1_82_816__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md356}{}\doxysection{Development}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8collab-proxy_0d1_82_816__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md356}
Check this repository out in your \{\$\+P\+R\+O\+J\+E\+CT\}/\+Packages/ folder, under the name com.\+unity.\+collab-\/proxy. The classes will be built by \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}}.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8collab-proxy_0d1_82_816__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md357}{}\doxysection{Testing}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8collab-proxy_0d1_82_816__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md357}
In order to run the tests, you will need to add this project to the testables key in your manifest.\+json -\/ once you have done this, the tests will be picked up by the \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} Test Runner window.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8collab-proxy_0d1_82_816__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md358}{}\doxysection{Building}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8collab-proxy_0d1_82_816__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md358}
You may build this project using msbuild. The commands to do so can be seen under .gitlab-\/ci.\+yml.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8collab-proxy_0d1_82_816__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md359}{}\doxysection{Deploying}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_8collab-proxy_0d1_82_816__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md359}
Gitlab will automatically build your project when you deploy. You can download the resulting artifact, which will be a dll, and place it in your Editor/bin/ folder. Open the package in \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} to generate the meta files, and then you will be able to publish.

We\textquotesingle{}re currently looking into a way to avoid this manual process.
