The {\bfseries{2D Pixel Perfect}} package contains the {\bfseries{Pixel Perfect Camera}} component, which ensures your pixel art remains crisp and clear at different resolutions, and stable in motion.

It is a single component that makes all the calculations \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} needs to scale the viewport with resolution changes, so that you don’t need to do it manually. You can use the component settings to adjust the definition of the rendered pixel art within the camera viewport, and you can use the {\bfseries{Run in Edit Mode}} feature to preview any changes immediately in the Game view.

 ~\newline


Attach the {\bfseries{Pixel Perfect Camera}} component to the main Camera Game\+Object in the Scene, it is represented by two green bounding boxes centered on the {\bfseries{Camera}} gizmo in the Scene view. The solid green bounding box shows the visible area in Game view, while the dotted bounding box shows the {\bfseries{Reference Resolution.}}

The {\bfseries{Reference Resolution}} is the original resolution your Assets are designed for, its effect on the component\textquotesingle{}s functions is detailed further in the documentation.

Before using the component, first ensure your Sprites are prepared correctly for best results with the the following steps.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8pixel-perfect_0d2_80_84__documentation_autotoc_md182}{}\doxysection{Preparing Your Sprites}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8pixel-perfect_0d2_80_84__documentation_autotoc_md182}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item After importing your textures into the project as Sprites, set all Sprites to the same {\bfseries{Pixels Per Unit}} value.


\item In the Sprites\textquotesingle{} Inspector window, set their {\bfseries{Filter Mode}} to ‘\+Point’.


\item Set their {\bfseries{Compression}} to \textquotesingle{}None\textquotesingle{}.


\item Follow the steps below to correctly set the pivot for a Sprite
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Open the {\bfseries{Sprite Editor}} for the selected Sprite.
\item If {\bfseries{Sprite Mode \+\_\+\+\_\+is set to ‘\+Multiple’ and there are multiple \+\_\+\+\_\+\+Sprite}} elements, then you need to set a pivot point for each individual Sprite element.
\item Under the Sprite settings, set {\bfseries{Pivot}} to ‘\+Custom’, then set {\bfseries{Pivot Unit Mode}} to ‘\+Pixels’. This allows you to set the pivot point\textquotesingle{}s coordinates in pixels, or drag the pivot point around freely in the {\bfseries{Sprite Editor}} and have it automatically snap to pixel corners.
\item Repeat for each {\bfseries{Sprite}} element as necessary.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To ensure the pixelated movement of Sprites are consistent with each other, follow the below steps to set the proper snap settings for your project.




\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item To open the {\bfseries{Snap settings}}, go to {\bfseries{Edit}} $>$ {\bfseries{Snap Settings.}}
\item Set the {\bfseries{Move X/\+Y/Z}} properties to 1 divided by the Pixel Perfect Camera’s {\bfseries{Asset Pixels Per Unit (P\+PU)}} value. For example, if the Asset {\bfseries{P\+PU}} is 100, you should set the {\bfseries{Move X/\+Y/Z}} properties to 0.\+01 (1 / 100 = 0.\+01).
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{namespace_unity}{Unity}} does not apply Snap settings retroactively. If there are any pre-\/existing Game\+Objects in the Scene, select each of them and select {\bfseries{Snap All Axes}} to apply the Snap settings.

This is the original resolution your Assets are designed for. Scaling up Scenes and Assets from this resolution preserves your pixel art cleanly at higher resolutions.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8pixel-perfect_0d2_80_84__documentation_autotoc_md187}{}\doxysubsection{Upscale Render Texture}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8pixel-perfect_0d2_80_84__documentation_autotoc_md187}
By default, the Scene is rendered at the pixel perfect resolution closest to the full screen resolution.

Enable this option to have the Scene rendered to a temporary texture set as close as possible to the {\bfseries{Reference Resolution}}, while maintaining the full screen aspect ratio. This temporary texture is then upscaled to fit the entire screen.



The result is unaliased and unrotated pixels, which may be a desirable visual style for certain game projects.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8pixel-perfect_0d2_80_84__documentation_autotoc_md188}{}\doxysubsection{Pixel Snapping}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8pixel-perfect_0d2_80_84__documentation_autotoc_md188}
Enable this feature to snap Sprite Renderers to a grid in world space at render-\/time. The grid size is based on the {\bfseries{Assets Pixels Per Unit}} value.

{\bfseries{Pixel Snapping}} prevents subpixel movement and make Sprites appear to move in pixel-\/by-\/pixel increments. This does not affect any Game\+Objects\textquotesingle{} Transform positions.\hypertarget{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8pixel-perfect_0d2_80_84__documentation_autotoc_md189}{}\doxysubsection{Crop Frame}\label{md__space_survival__library__package_cache_com_8unity_82d_8pixel-perfect_0d2_80_84__documentation_autotoc_md189}
Crops the viewport along the checked axis with black bars to match the {\bfseries{Reference Resolution}}. Black bars are added to make the Game view fit the full screen resolution.
